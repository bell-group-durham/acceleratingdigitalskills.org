<h3><i>Digital Skills Training Workshops for UK-based Music Researchers</i></h3>

<p>We are pleased to announce that <u>registration is now open</u> for the following three workshops aimed at music researchers, happening as part of the <i>“Accelerating embedded computational analysis of Web data about music in UK universities”</i> project (AH/X007316/1): </p>

<p><b>Workshop 1: Processing Text-Based Corpora for Musical Discourse Analysis</b></p>

<p><b>Workshop 2: Ethical and Methodological Essentials for Music Researchers using Web Data</b></p>

<p><b>Workshop 3: Command-Line Basics and Web Data Fundamentals for Music Researchers</b></p>

<p>All workshops are <i>free</i> and will be held online on Zoom. The workshops will start at 10:00 and finish at 16:00 BST, with ample breaks in between. Please find details of the workshops below and register your interest by completing the registration form for your preferred workshop. Applicants may register for more than one workshop.</p>

<p>Kindly note that to be eligible to participate in the workshop, <u>you have to be based in the UK.</u> A finite number of places are available, and completing the registration form does not automatically guarantee you a place in the workshop. Registration is open until <b>8 August 2023</b>. Applicants will be notified if they are allocated a place in due course.</p>

<h3>Workshop 1: Processing Text-Based Corpora for Musical Discourse Analysis</h3>

<p>Workshop Leader: Dr Maria Perevedentseva</p>

<p>Date and Time: Tuesday 15th August 2023, 10:00-16:00 BST</p>

<p>Location: Online (Zoom)</p>

<p>This workshop will provide a conceptually grounded introduction to some of the computational tools for analysing large text-based datasets about music. We will work with browser-based tools including Voyant and TensorFlow’s Embedding Projector, and practice live coding in Python in order to explore various properties of the datasets, derive meaningful information about their contents and understand the quantitative and qualitative relations they reveal. Upon completion of the workshop, it is expected that participants will have a grasp of the foundational concepts of natural language processing and corpus linguistics that will enable them to design and implement larger projects of their own.</p> 
 
<p>No prior programming experience is necessary, but participants are asked to install the free <a  href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> software in advance of the workshop.</p>

<h3>Workshop 2: Ethical and Methodological Essentials for Music Researchers using Web Data</h3>

<p>Workshop Leader: Dr Steven Gamble</p>
<p>Date and Time: Monday 21st August 2023, 10:00-16:00 BST</p>
<p>Location: Online (Zoom)</p>

<p>This workshop invites participants interested in researching Web data about music to consider and work through key ethical and methodological considerations. We will examine best practice principles and ethical guidelines developed in neighbouring fields in addition to specific case studies in existing research on music and the internet. The workshop will encourage participants to actively address issues of legality, privacy, fairness, inclusion, and social justice in designing research projects including Web data.</p>

<p>Register your interest for this workshop <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/BMU2fYzZ56">here.</a></p>

<br>

<h3>Workshop 3: Command-Line Basics and Web Data Fundamentals for Music Researchers</h3>

<p>Workshop Leader: Dr Eamonn Bell</p>
<p>Date and Time: Wednesday 30th August 2023, 10:00-16:00 BST</p>
<p>Location: Online (Zoom)</p>

<p>This workshop will introduce the basics of interacting with command-line applications and will demonstrate a variety of command-line tools that are useful for the retrieval and storage of large amounts of data about music that circulates online, including an introduction to HTTP APIs. The workshop is targeted at participants who already feel comfortable using graphical tools (e.g., web browsers, Excel) to access and perform basic analyses of Web data about music online.</p>

<h3>(25/05/2023) Launch of Digital Skills and Needs of Music Researchers Survey</h3>

<p>We are happy to announce that we have now launched our <a href="https://bit.ly/MusicResearchDigitalSkillsSurvey">Digital Skills and Needs of Music Researchers Survey.</a> We are inviting UK-based music researchers to participate in this online study to help us understand the needs of researchers with regards to working with web data for their music research. Findings from this survey will inform the structure of the free online training workshops which will be carried out in the future.</p>

<p>The study takes approximately 15-20 minutes, and at the end of the survey, participants may opt in to receive updates on the workshops and other studies connected to this project, as well as participate in a raffle for a £10 Amazon voucher.</p>

<p>Participate in the survey <a href="https://bit.ly/MusicResearchDigitalSkillsSurvey">here.</a> </p>

<h3>(27/02/2023) Announcing “Accelerating Embedded Computational Analysis of Web Data about Music in UK Universities”</h3>

<p>We are pleased to announce that the AHRC-funded project, “Accelerating embedded computational analysis of Web data about music in UK universities” is starting soon. We will begin with a series of trainings for workshop leaders in the Software Carpentries methodology. We will also soon circulate a survey to music researchers based in the UK to determine the skills gap in music research with Web data so as to better tailor the proposed training sessions to the your needs. If you would like to learn more about the project, please contact <a href = "mailto: eamonn.bell@durham.ac.uk">Eamonn Bell</a>.</p>
